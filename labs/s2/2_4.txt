# Comment:
# 1 - The Gaussian filter is a low pass filter, which is convenient for smoothing images (since errors are high-frequency)
# So, the peppers are smoothed.

# 2 - In our case, we have increased sigma. The greater the sigma, the more smoothing.

# 3 - Median filter: The median filter, which is a non-linear filter, does not smooth so much the image.
# Instead, it can be used to remove salt&pepper noise from images, because it takes the median value of the pixel,
# so extreme values are filtered out.
